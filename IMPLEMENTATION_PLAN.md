Implementation Plan

Phase 0 – Foundations (Week 0-1)
- Confirm brand voice, glossary sources, and reviewer SLAs with stakeholders.
- Stand up project scaffolding (Next.js frontend, API service, PostgreSQL, Redis, S3 buckets).
- Configure secrets management, linting, formatting, CI skeleton, and monitoring hooks (Sentry/OpenTelemetry).

Phase 1 – Knowledge Base & Controls (Week 1-2)
- Import initial glossary/style guides into PostgreSQL with admin tooling for updates.
- Implement glossary API endpoints and caching with Redis; expose CRUD in internal admin UI.
- Define prompt templates and guardrails referencing glossary entries and brand tone metadata.

Phase 2 – Draft Generation Pipeline (Week 2-3)
- Integrate LLM provider (OpenAI/Claude) with retry, cost logging, and fallbacks to Google Translate.
- Build translation request service that orchestrates retrieval of glossary/style context and produces Thai drafts.
- Add sensitive-term linting and configurable blocked-word checks post-generation.

Phase 3 – Editor & Reviewer Workflow (Week 3-5)
- Implement submission UI for uploading/pasting English content (plain text + file upload to S3).
- Deliver editing workspace with side-by-side draft/final views, comment threads, and version diffing (PostgreSQL history tables).
- Create reviewer approval flow with status transitions, notifications, and audit logging.

Phase 4 – Quality, Metrics & Exports (Week 5-6)
- Capture post-edit distance, turnaround time, glossary compliance metrics; expose dashboards/reports.
- Implement export adapters for CSV, DOCX, and social channel templates with field mapping.
- Add reviewer checklist enforcement and automated QA sampling hooks.

Phase 5 – Hardening & Launch (Week 6-7)
- Load test key endpoints, validate latency and throughput targets, and run security review.
- Finalize RBAC roles, data retention policies, and PII redaction verification.
- Pilot with select content managers, collect feedback, iterate, and prepare public rollout communications.
